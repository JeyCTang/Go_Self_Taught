# Go Self Study Notebook
[TOC]


## Abstract
This is the notebook which contains some important point during the process of my Golang studying.

## 1. Running and Compiling
- <b>Running result could not show on the interface of GoLand</b> \
  If your IDE is GoLand, sometimes the result of running can’t be shown, but if you run it in the terminal there is no 
  problem, so if you ensure your code has no problem but you can’t see the result by ‘run’ of GoLand then just try to 
  run it via terminal.
