## Sampling
### Important - download CC extract data! 
To run sampling scripts you need to download all json files from the official Charity Commission beta extract [here](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/register/full-register-download) and put them in the `res/cc_data_extract` directory.
